# Pythonic Objects

This repository contains Python 3 Jupyter Notebooks and example code used to present the tutorial [Pythonic Objects: : idiomatic OOP in Python](https://us.pycon.org/2019/schedule/presentation/76/) at PyCon US 2019.

This is *all* the material used in the tutorial, but there's more spoken content in the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUu_4k6a5-I.
