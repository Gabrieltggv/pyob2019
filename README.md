# Pythonic Objects

This repository contains all the material used to present the tutorial [Pythonic Objects: idiomatic OOP in Python](https://us.pycon.org/2019/schedule/presentation/76/) at PyCon US 2019.

The material consists of Python 3 Jupyter Notebooks, example code, and doctests for two labs (only the first was used at PyCon 2019).

There's more content in the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUu_4k6a5-I), including spoken words, hand waving, comments and Q&A with the participants.
